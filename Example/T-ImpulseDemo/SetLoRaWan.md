# This article describes how to connect T-Impulse to TTN V3
### necessity:
- A gateway that can connect to TTN V3
- One T-Impulse
- One Type-C cable
- A TTN account

## Step
1. Open the TTN website, establish a gateway, and connect the gateway to the TTN server [(refer to the construction of the gateway)](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/SX1302_HAL_GATEWAY)

4. Remember the three fields AppEUI, DevEUI, AppKey,
Where AppEUI and DevEUI are in LSB format, and AppKey is in MSB format

6. Set T-Impulse to DFU mode (first press and hold the BOOT button, then press the RST button, release RST and then release the BOOT button), if you have any questions, [(please refer to here)](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T-Impulse)

7. Click platfromIO to start burning, the following picture is displayed, which means the upload is successful

9. T-Impulse has been successfully connected to TTN V3 so far
## Cayenne example
Based on the above steps, forwarding the device to cayenne requires:
  - cayenne account

  ### Step:
  1. At present, a small part of the Cayenne package has been integrated in the sample program, so just create a Cayenne device directly
